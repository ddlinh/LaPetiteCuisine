                        <p>
                            La Petite Cuisine was founded by Dang Diem Linh in 2004. 
                            It was called LesChefs, and started as a blog and an online community 
                            where some of the world's first chefs experts shared their research and ideas. 
                            We launched the Beginner's Guide to cook and our first Search Ranking Factors study, 
                            and that hub of industry expertise transformed into a small consulting firm and led us to create some of our first SEO tools.

                            With our broader marketing efforts in full swing, we rebranded from LesChefs to La Petite Cuisine in 2013. 
                            We released a suite of campaign-based tools called La Petite Cuisine Analytics that included features for content, 
                            social media, and brand management in addition to links and rankings. We also celebrated 10 years in search 
                            and welcomed long-time Vinh Duong as our new CEO.

                        La Petite Cuisine, formerly LesChefs, has a name that was inspired by organizations like Chefmoz â€” 
                    company that strove for engaging their communities with openness and integrity. 
                    From the very beginning, we felt passionately about bringing that same integrity to the frustratingly opaque cooking industry.
